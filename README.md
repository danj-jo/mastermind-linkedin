# Mastermind - Reach Apprenticeship Project

Welcome to Mastermind! This is my version of the classic Mastermind game that features both Single and Multiplayer modes. The goal is to guess a secret number combination within 10 attempts, with feedback after every guess. The game features log in, registration, game history, the ability to resume past games, and a queue based match-making system, where users play as a team to solve the secret combination. The game exists as a Rest API for most use cases, but switches over to Websockets for multiplayer games, using the STOMP protocol to broadcast messages to clients and publishing messages from clients.

## üéÆ Game Rules

- At the start of a game, the computer randomly selects a secret pattern of numbers.
- The length of the pattern depends on the chosen difficulty:
  - **Easy** ‚Üí 4 digits (0‚Äì7)
  - **Medium** ‚Üí 6 digits (0‚Äì7)
  - **Hard** ‚Üí 8 digits (0‚Äì7)
- A player (or team in multiplayer) has **10 attempts** to guess the correct pattern.
- After each guess, feedback is provided:
  - **Correct number** guessed but wrong position
  - **Correct number in the correct position**
  - **Incorrect guess** (no matches)
- Invalid guesses (duplicates, non-numeric input, or wrong length) are rejected and **don‚Äôt** count as attempts.
- The game ends with either a **win (correct pattern guessed)** or **loss (attempts used up)**.

### Example Run

Secret: `0 1 3 5`  
- Guess `2 2 4 6` ‚Üí *All incorrect*  
- Guess `0 2 4 6` ‚Üí *1 correct number, 1 correct location*  
- Guess `2 2 1 1` ‚Üí *1 correct number, 0 correct location*  
- Guess `0 1 5 6` ‚Üí *3 correct numbers, 2 correct location*

> Feedback never reveals **which digits** are correct ‚Äî only how many are correct.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Tech Stack
-**Backend**: Java 17 with Spring Boot 3.5.5
-**Database**: PostgreSQL using JDBC and JPA for persistence
-**API Layer**: RESTful endpoints for core game logic, user management, and singleplayer mode
-**Real-Time Communication**: WebSockets with STOMP protocol for multiplayer messaging and event broadcasting
-**Frontend**: React 19 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS for a responsive, modern UI
-**Build Tools**: Maven (backend) and Vite (frontend) for fast, modular builds
-**Testing**: JUnit 5 and Mockito for unit and integration testing

### Why Java & Spring Boot?

After my previous REACH project using JavaScript + MongoDB, I chose Java & Spring Boot for several key reasons:

1. **Static Typing**: Java's compile-time type checking prevents runtime errors and enhances code readability
2. **Robust Framework**: Spring Boot provides excellent support for WebSockets, authentication, authorization, and CORS
3. **Enterprise-Grade**: Built-in security features like CSRF protection and role-based authentication
4. **JPA**: JPA allowed me to make queries faster, to put more energy into core game logic. When complex custom queries were needed, I could rely on JPQL. 

### üíæ Why PostgreSQL?

The choice of **PostgreSQL** was driven by the need to manage **complex relationships** between players, games, and guesses:

- **Player ‚Üî Game Relationships**: Each player can participate in multiple games, and each game can include one or more players (especially in multiplayer mode).  
- **Game ‚Üî Guesses**: Each game maintains a list of guesses made by players, which allows structured queries and game resumption.  
- **Data Integrity**: Foreign keys and transactions ensure relationships remain consistent.  
- **Efficient Queries**: Indexing and relational tables allow fast retrieval of game history, leaderboard stats, and player performance.  
- **Future Flexibility**: Makes implementing features like leaderboards, friends, or analytics straightforward.

## üéÆ Game Features

### Single Player Mode
- **Difficulty Levels**: Easy (4 digits), Medium (6 digits), Hard (8 digits)
- **Game Persistence**: Save and resume games
- **Smart Hints**: Automatic feedback on guess accuracy
- **Game History**: Track past games and performance

### Multiplayer Mode
- **Real-time Matchmaking**: Queue-based system with difficulty-specific rooms
- **Live Updates**: WebSocket communication for instant game state updates
- **Turn-based Gameplay**: Structured guessing with player identification
- **Memory Management**: Games stored in memory until completion

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture Patterns

### MVC Pattern Implementation
- **Model**: JPA entities representing game state and user data
- **View**: React components with responsive UI
- **Controller**: RESTful endpoints with WebSocket support

## üìä Data Models

### Core Entities

#### Player
```java
@Entity
public class Player implements UserDetails {
    private UUID playerId;
    private String username;
    private String email;
    private String password;
    private String role; // ROLE_USER, ROLE_ADMIN
}
```
- Implements Spring Security's `UserDetails` for authentication
- Lean design focused on user representation
- Role-based access control integration

#### SinglePlayerGame
```java
@Entity
public class SinglePlayerGame {
    private UUID gameId;
    private Player player;
    private String winningNumber;
    private Difficulty difficulty;
    private List<String> guesses;
    private Result result;
    private boolean isFinished;
    
    public String submitGuess(String guess) {
        // Core game logic with validation
    }
}
```
- Separate guesses table for optimal query performance
- Built-in game logic with state management
- Resume capability with game persistence

#### MultiplayerGame
```java
@Entity
public class MultiplayerGame {
    private UUID gameId;
    private Player player1;
    private Player player2;
    private String winningNumber;
    private List<MultiplayerGuess> guesses;
    private Result result;
    private boolean isFinished;
}
```
- Two-player game structure
- Separate `MultiplayerGuess` entities for player identification
- Memory-based storage for active games

#### Enums
```java
public enum Difficulty { EASY, MEDIUM, HARD }
public enum Result { PENDING, WIN, LOSS }
public enum GameMode { SINGLE_PLAYER, MULTIPLAYER }
```

## üîß Services & Controllers

### Service Layer

- **Leaderboards**: Global and personal statistics

## üå± Personal Growth Milestones

This project represents significant growth from my previous REACH submission. I explored and applied several new concepts, including:

- **Relational Databases** ‚Äì Modeling and querying entity relationships to support multiplayer game logic
- **WebSocket Communication** ‚Äì Building real-time matchmaking and event dispatch using STOMP and SSE
- **Security Fundamentals** ‚Äì Implementing CSRF protection, SQL injection prevention, and full authentication/authorization flows
- **Thread Safety** ‚Äì Managing concurrent access with thread-safe structures like ConcurrentHashMap
- **STOMP Protocol** ‚Äì Intercepting and handling lifecycle events (CONNECT, SEND, DISCONNECT) for session tracking
- **Server-Sent Events** ‚Äì Using SSE to notify clients and coordinate multiplayer state transitions

The increased complexity pushed me to adopt proper architectural patterns, improve lifecycle visibility, and design for maintainability‚Äîskills. I was also able to see the vision come to life, with the creation of the front end.
